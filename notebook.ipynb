    "# LLM Mathematics Research - Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `ScaffoldedResearcher` class to run an automated research experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this does:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ScaffoldedResearcher` implements a generator-critic loop where:\n",
    "1. **Generator AI** produces research outputs (LaTeX papers + Python code + data analysis)\n",
    "2. **Critic AI** reviews the work and provides structured feedback\n",
    "3. The loop iterates for a specified number of rounds, with each iteration building on previous work\n",
    "\n",
    "## This example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Statistical analysis of temperature-humidity correlation\n",
    "- **Reference Paper**: Example paper on weather data analysis\n",
    "- **Dataset**: 10 days of temperature and humidity measurements\n",
    "- **Iterations**: 4 rounds of generation → critique → refinement\n",
    "- **Output**: Complete research paper with analysis, figures, and citations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexible API (pip-installable):\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the flexible API that works after pip installation:\n",
    "- `api_key`: Pass your Anthropic API key directly (or use environment variable)\n",
    "- `papers`: Pass paper content as a dictionary (no file system dependency)\n",
    "- `data_paths`: Pass full paths to your data files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Results will be saved to `outputs/{session_name}/`:\n",
    "- `paper.pdf` - Final compiled research paper\n",
    "- `code.py` - Generated Python analysis code\n",
    "- `*.png` - Generated figures\n",
    "- Various logs and intermediate files"
