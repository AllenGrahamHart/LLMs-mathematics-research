# AI-Generated Mathematics Paper Evaluation Form

Thank you for participating in this research evaluation study! We are investigating how well AI systems can produce mathematical research papers. 

The AI system was given one or more of your papers as context and asked to develop and write its own research contribution building on that work.

**Estimated time:** 15-25 minutes

## Context

**Your paper(s) provided as context:**
[Paper title(s) will be shown here]

**AI-generated paper:**
[Link to PDF will be shown here]

## Part 1: Soundness

**Q1: Is the paper fundamentally sound?**

○ **YES** - Theorems, proofs, definitions, and numerical experiments could contain minor errors but these could be fixed with small changes. The core ideas and approach are sound.

○ **NO** - There are serious, fatal problems: theorems have counterexamples to their core claims (theorems cannot be saved by adding an extra condition for example); proof strategies are fundamentally unworkable; definitions are nonsensical or circular; numerical experiments are irrelevant or meaningless.

*If you answered NO, please skip to Part 3.*

## Part 2: Novelty & Difficulty
*(Only answer if Q1 = YES)*

**Q2: How impressive is the paper in terms of novelty and complexity?**

The novelty and complexity is graded on a 6 point scale, where each point corresponds to:

○ **An undergraduate (1st/2nd year) summer project report**

○ **An undergraduate/masters final year project report**

○ **A PhD student's first publishable paper**

○ **A strong paper typical of an established researcher**

○ **A seminal paper that significantly advances the field**

○ **A paper that would win the author a Field's medal**

## Part 3: Detailed Feedback
*(Optional but greatly appreciated)*

**Q3: Academic integrity concerns**

Did you notice any issues with academic honesty—such as fabricated references, falsified experimental results, insufficient attribution, or false claims of novelty? Please describe any concerns.
