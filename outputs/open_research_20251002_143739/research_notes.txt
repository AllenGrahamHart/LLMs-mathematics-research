INITIAL RESEARCH FOCUS (to be refined):
========================================

I'm leaning toward: "Information Geometry of Reservoir Computing"

Why interesting:
- Connects reservoir computing to differential geometry
- Provides theoretical framework for understanding representations
- Can lead to practical design principles
- Relatively unexplored in literature

Specific angles:
1. Measure curvature of reservoir state space manifolds
2. Relate geometric properties to task performance
3. Design reservoirs with desired geometric properties
4. Connection to tangent kernel theory

Next steps:
- Implement basic reservoir computing framework
- Develop tools to analyze state space geometry
- Design experiments on benchmark tasks
