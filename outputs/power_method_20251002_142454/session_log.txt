# Overall Strategy for 20 Iterations

Given the scope and constraints, here's my planned allocation:

## Phase 1: Foundation (Iterations 1-4)
- **Iteration 1**: Set up paper structure, introduction, and algorithm statement
- **Iteration 2**: Write rigorous convergence proof with all steps
- **Iteration 3**: Implement basic power method in Python
- **Iteration 4**: Run first experiment on 3x3 matrix, generate error plot

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Iterations 5-10)
- **Iterations 5-7**: Add more experiments (eigenvector convergence, multiple test cases, convergence rate analysis)
- **Iterations 8-9**: Write applications section, connect to practical uses (PageRank, PCA, etc.)
- **Iteration 10**: Add related work and literature context

## Phase 3: Refinement (Iterations 11-16)
- **Iterations 11-13**: Polish mathematical exposition, improve proof clarity
- **Iterations 14-15**: Enhance figures, add captions, improve visualizations
- **Iteration 16**: Refine writing for engagement and flow

## Phase 4: Completion (Iterations 17-20)
- **Iterations 17-18**: Final experiments, comprehensive results section
- **Iterations 19-20**: Final polish, ensure all requirements met, buffer for any issues

**Key Principles:**
1. Build iteratively - complete draft early, then refine
2. Interleave theory and practice
3. Generate and save figures explicitly with each code run
4. Maintain one cohesive LaTeX document throughout
5. Keep 2-3 iterations as buffer

Let's begin with **Iteration 1**!
