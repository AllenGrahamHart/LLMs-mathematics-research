# Calculate sin(x) and cos(x)

plt.plot(x, y_sin, label='sin(x)', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(x, y_cos, label='cos(x)', linewidth=2)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Plot of sin(x) and cos(x) from 0 to 2π')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Set x-axis ticks to show π values
plt.xticks([0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2, 2*np.pi], 
           ['0', 'π/2', 'π', '3π/2', '2π'])

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code will create a clean plot showing both sine and cosine functions over the interval [0, 2π]. The plot includes:
- Both sin(x) and cos(x) curves with different colors
- A legend to identify each curve
- Grid lines for easier reading
- X-axis labels in terms of π for better readability
- Proper labels and title

\section{Introduction}

This document presents a brief overview of our research findings. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the integration of graphical data and textual analysis within a structured academic format. Through careful examination of the experimental results, we aim to provide insights that contribute to the broader understanding of the field.

Modern research methodologies increasingly rely on visual representations to convey complex information effectively. The following sections present our key findings, supported by graphical evidence that illustrates the patterns and trends observed during our investigation.

\section{Results and Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:results} presents the primary findings from our experimental work. The visualization demonstrates the key relationships and patterns identified through our analytical approach.

    \caption{Experimental results showing the main findings of this study.}
    \label{fig:results}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:results}, the data reveals several important characteristics that warrant further discussion. These observations form the foundation for our conclusions and suggest potential directions for future research endeavors.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a concise analysis of our research findings, supported by graphical evidence. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a solid foundation for continued investigation in this area.

This is a test research paper demonstrating the basic structure of a LaTeX document with figures. It includes an introduction section and a figure section to showcase document formatting capabilities.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This document serves as a demonstration of a basic research paper structure in LaTeX. The introduction provides context and background for the research topic. In scientific writing, the introduction typically outlines the problem being addressed, reviews relevant literature, and states the objectives of the study.

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system widely used in academia for producing high-quality technical and scientific documentation. Its ability to handle complex mathematical equations, cross-references, and figures makes it the preferred choice for researchers across various disciplines.

This particular document demonstrates how to incorporate figures into a LaTeX document, which is essential for presenting visual data, graphs, and illustrations that support the research findings.

\section{Results and Figures}

In this section, we present the visual results of our analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:result} shows the generated visualization that illustrates our key findings.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure_1_0.png}
    \caption{Generated visualization showing the results of the analysis. This figure demonstrates the key findings of our research.}
    \label{fig:result}
\end{figure}

As can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig:result}, the visualization provides clear evidence supporting our hypothesis. The figure has been scaled to 80\% of the text width to ensure optimal readability while maintaining detail.

\section{Conclusion}

This test document has successfully demonstrated the basic structure of a LaTeX research paper, including title, abstract, introduction, and a section with an embedded figure. LaTeX provides excellent tools for academic writing and document preparation.
