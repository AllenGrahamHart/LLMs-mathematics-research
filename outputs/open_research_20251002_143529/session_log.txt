# Strategy for 1 Iteration

Given the severe constraint of **only 1 iteration**, I need to be highly efficient and strategic. Here's my plan:

## Overall Approach
I'll conduct a **focused computational study** on reservoir computing that:
1. Can be completed in a single iteration
2. Produces meaningful, novel insights
3. Has clear theoretical motivation
4. Generates compelling visualizations

## Proposed Research Direction
Based on the reservoir computing literature, I'll investigate **the relationship between reservoir hyperparameters and task-specific performance**, specifically:
- How spectral radius, sparsity, and input scaling affect different computational tasks
- The interplay between memory requirements and nonlinear processing
- Optimal parameter regimes for different problem classes

This is tractable because:
- The experiments are well-defined and bounded
- I can implement a clean RC framework quickly
- Results will be interpretable and visual
- It connects to fundamental questions in the field

## Single Iteration Plan

**Phase 1: Setup & Implementation (20%)**
- Implement core reservoir computing framework
- Set up 2-3 canonical tasks (memory, nonlinear transformation, temporal pattern)

**Phase 2: Experiments (30%)**
- Systematic parameter sweep over spectral radius, sparsity, input scaling
- Test on multiple tasks
- Generate all figures (performance heatmaps, trajectory visualizations, etc.)

**Phase 3: Paper Writing (50%)**
- Write complete paper with all sections
- Introduction with proper context
- Methods describing framework
- Results with figures
- Discussion connecting to broader literature
- Proper citations

Let me execute this now!
