I'm a postdoc at Warwick University (UK) conducting a study to assess how well an AI agent can autonomously write entire mathematics research papers with freedom to choose it's own research questions. 

If this sounds interesting to you please read on!

The goal is to get a large sample of mathematicians (100+) to each review a unique AI written paper in their field of expertise.

For each academic in the sample I selected at least one of their papers to provide to the AI agent as context.

As you were selected to be in the sample (if you wish to participate) I selected the following paper(s) of yours

[papers]

Building on the ideas contained in your papers, the agent has written its own paper - which is in the attached .pdf.

I am interested in how highly or poorly you rate the quality of the AI generated paper.

To collect this data in a structured way, I created a survey.

If you want to participate in the survey please review the attached paper and answer the first 3 questions in the survey - which is in the body of this email.

Questions 4-7 are optional open ended questions where you can leave an extended review.

All answers to the survey and participants will be anonymous by default unless you wish to waive anonymity.

Feel free to review the paper with colleagues, a supervisor or a PhD student.

If any of your colleagues are interested in participating as well, they can email me and I will try my best to include them.

The full experimental code, including prompts etc can be found here:

If you are interested in becoming involved with the project (e.g. developing the agent further, evaluating it across other areas) I am always interested in collaboration!

If you have any further questions or comments, please ask.
