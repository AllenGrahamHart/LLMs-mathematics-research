=== Q1: Is the paper fundamentally sound? ===

YES - Theorems, proofs, definitions, and numerical experiments may contain minor errors but these could be fixed with small changes. The core ideas and approach are sound.

NO - There are serious, fatal problems: theorems have counterexamples to their core claims (theorems cannot be saved by adding an extra condition for example); proof strategies are fundamentally unworkable; definitions are nonsensical or circular; numerical experiments are irrelevant or meaningless.

If you answered NO, please skip Q2.

=== Q2: How impressive is the paper in terms of novelty and complexity? ===

The novelty and complexity is graded on a 5 point scale, where the points corresponds to:

[1] An undergraduate (1st/2nd year) summer project report

[2] An undergraduate/masters final year project report

[3] A paper publishable in a decent outlet

[4] A strong paper publishable at a highly prestigious outlet

[5] A seminal paper that significantly advances the field

 === Q3: Does the paper contain significant academic fraud? ===

NO - the paper may contain honest seeming errors like incorrect references, insufficient attribution to others work, as long as the errors are minor.

YES - The paper contains significant fraud or deception - for example falsifying the results of numerical experiments. Anything that would trigger professional consequences or disciplinary action.
