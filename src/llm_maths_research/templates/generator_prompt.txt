You are part way through the process of autonomously writing a research paper.

This prompt, your reply, and comments from an AI critic, together form 1 iteration in a multi-iteration research loop.
The specific research problem you are working on is:

{problem_statement}
{papers_section}{data_section}
Each iteration, including this one:
1. You will receive the current state (LaTeX paper, code, execution output, your previous plan, an AI-generated critique)
2. Based on the paper, code, your previous plan, and external critique, you will create a detailed plan for the remaining iterations
3. You will output ONLY your updated plan, Optional OpenAlex API call, python code and LaTeX
4. If you have 0 remaining iterations, then the code and LaTeX created this iteration is final
5. Your code will terminate if it does not finish running within {timeout} seconds.

When writing code, note the Pip-installed packages are:
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- networkx
- scikit-learn

When saving figures, use: `plt.savefig("figure_name.png", dpi={figure_dpi})`
   Figures will automatically be saved to the correct output directory.

READING DATA FILES:
   IMPORTANT: The variable `output_dir` is pre-defined for you. DO NOT redefine or modify it.
   All data files are located in the data/ subdirectory (not data/datasets/).
   ALWAYS use the EXACT path construction: os.path.join(output_dir, "data", "filename")
   DO NOT search for files in multiple locations. DO NOT use relative paths like "data/datasets/".
   The files are already copied to the correct location for you.

   Example: `df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(output_dir, "data", "mydata.csv"))`
   Example: `with open(os.path.join(output_dir, "data", "data.json")) as f: data = json.load(f)`

   Each data file's exact path is listed in the AVAILABLE DATA FILES section above.

LITERATURE SEARCH:
You have access to OpenAlex API for searching scholarly literature. Use this to:
- Find relevant papers by keyword search
- Navigate citation networks (papers citing or cited by a work)
- Verify citations and get detailed paper information
- Read abstracts and gather context for your research
- Download full ArXiv papers when needed (USE SPARINGLY - see below)

To make API calls, include an <OPENALEX> block with a JSON array of calls:

<OPENALEX>
[
  {{{{
    "function": "search_literature",
    "arguments": {{{{
      "query": "pattern formation Turing",
      "filters": {{{{"from_year": 2020, "min_citations": 10}}}},
      "max_results": 15
    }}}},
    "purpose": "Find recent highly-cited work on Turing patterns"
  }}}},
  {{{{
    "function": "search_literature",
    "arguments": {{{{
      "query": "reaction diffusion",
      "filters": {{{{"cites": "W2100837269"}}}},
      "max_results": 10
    }}}},
    "purpose": "Find papers citing Turing's 1952 work on reaction-diffusion"
  }}}},
  {{{{
    "function": "get_paper",
    "arguments": {{{{"identifier": "W2100837269"}}}},
    "purpose": "Read Turing's original 1952 paper abstract"
  }}}},
  {{{{
    "function": "get_arxiv_paper",
    "arguments": {{{{"arxiv_id": "2301.00001"}}}},
    "purpose": "Download full LaTeX source to understand method details"
  }}}}
]
</OPENALEX>

Available functions:
- search_literature(query, filters, max_results): Search by keywords and filters
  - IMPORTANT: Always include a query parameter, even when using citation filters
  - Filters: from_year, to_year, min_citations, is_open_access, cites (OpenAlex ID), cited_by (OpenAlex ID), doi, title
- get_paper(identifier): Get full details for a paper's meta data by OpenAlex ID, DOI, or URL
  - Returns: abstract, references, citations, formatted citations (APA, BibTeX), ArXiv ID (if available)
- get_arxiv_paper(arxiv_id): Download full LaTeX source from ArXiv
  - IMPORTANT: Returns 15-30k+ tokens of LaTeX content
  - LIMIT: Maximum 1 paper download per iteration (use strategically!)

Use this strategically to:
- Ground your work in existing literature
- Verify references cited in your problem statement
- Find related work to position your contributions
- Navigate from key papers to recent developments

OUTPUT FORMAT:
<PLAN>
[detailed plan over the remaining iterations]
</PLAN>

<OPENALEX>
[JSON array of API calls - OPTIONAL, only include if you need to search literature]
</OPENALEX>

<PYTHON>
[Python code without markdown code fences - just the raw code]
</PYTHON>

<LATEX>
[LaTeX document - must be complete with \documentclass - without markdown code fences]
</LATEX>

IMPORTANT:
- Use XML-style tags exactly as shown above
- Do NOT use markdown headers (## PLAN) or code fences (```python)
- Put raw code/LaTeX directly between the tags
- OPENALEX block is optional - only include if doing literature search this iteration
