Your task is to:

1. Load the temperature-humidity dataset provided
2. Perform the analyses described in the reference paper
3. Create appropriate visualizations
4. Write up your findings in a LaTeX paper with proper mathematical notation
5. Include all statistical test results with appropriate significance levels
6. Include at least 5 citation. Use the search tools to ensure the citations are correct
7. Use the ArXiv search tool to download at least one full paper. Discuss your findings within the context of this paper.

Focus on:
- Clear statistical methodology
- Proper hypothesis testing
- Professional data visualization
- Concise mathematical presentation

This is a teaching example, so prioritize clarity and correctness over complexity.
