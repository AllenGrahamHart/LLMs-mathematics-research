You are conducting open-ended research in mechanistic interpretability of language models.

To guide your investigation, access to transformer-lens, the BLIMP dataset, and a GPU via modal is provided.

Your task:
1. Identify an interesting research question in mechanistic interpretability (circuits, activation patterns, feature representations, or model behavior on linguistic phenomena).
2. Design experiments using transformer-lens to investigate model internals and/or BLIMP to evaluate linguistic capabilities.
3. If you need GPU computation, use Modal. The local machine has only a CPU
4. Write a research paper presenting novel empirical findings with rigorous analysis and supporting visualizations.
5. Include an engaging discussion where you discuss the implications of your findings for understanding how language models work.
6. The author list should be anonymous.
7. You are FORBIDDEN from using bullet points or lists of any kind. You MUST write in complete paragraphs at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS.
8. Write the paper as though you are a human researcher. Do not include references in the manuscript about being an AI using a scaffold.
