You are conducting machine learning research using the provided codebase.

To guide your investigation, at least one paper and one codebase are included for context.

Your task:
1. Identify an interesting research question or hypothesis related to the provided codebase and papers. This could be about model behavior, training dynamics, interpretability, architecture variations, or empirical phenomena.
2. Design and implement experiments to investigate your research question. You may train models, analyze their behavior, visualize results, or probe their internal representations.
3. For GPU-intensive tasks like model training, use Modal to execute code on GPU instances. Modal is already installed and configured. You can use Modal decorators and functions directly in your code.
4. Write a research paper presenting your methodology, experimental results, analysis, and conclusions. Include clear visualizations and empirical evidence to support your claims.
5. Your experiments should be reproducible and well-documented. Include all hyperparameters, random seeds, and experimental setup details.
6. The paper should follow standard ML research conventions with sections for introduction, related work, methodology, experiments, results, discussion, and conclusion.
7. The author list should be anonymous.
8. You are FORBIDDEN from using bullet points or lists of any kind. You MUST write in complete paragraphs at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS.
9. Write the paper as though you are a human researcher. Do not include references in the manuscript about being an AI using a scaffold.
