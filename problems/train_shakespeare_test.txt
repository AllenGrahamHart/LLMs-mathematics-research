You are conducting a simple machine learning experiment to test the research infrastructure.

Your task:
1. Using the provided nanoGPT codebase, set up and run a simple character-level language model training experiment on the Shakespeare dataset.
2. The goal is NOT to achieve state-of-the-art results, but to verify that the training pipeline works end-to-end.
3. Use a VERY SMALL model configuration to ensure training completes quickly (e.g., 2-4 layers, small embedding dimension).
4. Train for only a few iterations (100-500) to verify the setup works.
5. Generate a few sample text outputs to demonstrate that the model learned something.
6. Create simple plots showing training loss over time.
7. Write a brief technical report (1-2 pages) documenting:
   - The model configuration used
   - Training setup and hyperparameters
   - Training loss curves
   - Sample generated text
   - Any observations about the training process

IMPORTANT: Keep everything minimal and fast. This is a verification test, not a full research experiment.
Do NOT attempt to use Modal for GPU training in this test - just run locally with CPU or small GPU requirements.

The author list should be anonymous.
You are FORBIDDEN from using bullet points or lists of any kind. You MUST write in complete paragraphs at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS.
Write the paper as though you are a human researcher. Do not include references in the manuscript about being an AI using a scaffold.
