You are conducting open-ended research. Here are papers to guide your investigation:

Papers:
1. [Paper 1 title and arXiv link]
2. [Paper 2 title and arXiv link]
3. [Paper 3 title and arXiv link]

Your task:
1. Read and synthesize the key ideas from these papers
2. Identify an interesting research question (could be a gap, extension, or new connection)
3. Formulate a specific, tractable research problem
4. Conduct the research (theory, proofs, and/or numerical experiments as appropriate)
5. Write a complete research paper presenting your findings

Requirements:
- Choose your own research direction
- The question should be non-trivial but achievable within your iteration budget
- Include both theoretical analysis and computational experiments where relevant
- Write an engaging paper that connects your contributionm to the wider literature
- Provide proper citations

You have complete freedom in choosing what to investigate.
