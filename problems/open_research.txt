You are conducting open-ended research on reservoir computing.

To guide your investigation consider the PhD thesis and 2 recent papers by Allen G Hart

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14226
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09515
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21522

Your task:
1. Identify an interesting research question (could be a gap, extension, or new connection)
2. Formulate a specific, tractable research problem
3. Conduct the research (theory, proofs, and/or numerical experiments as appropriate)
4. Write a complete research paper presenting your findings

Requirements:
- Choose your own research direction
- The question should be non-trivial but achievable within your iteration budget
- The work should be novel - it cannot have been done before
- Include both theoretical analysis and computational experiments where relevant
- Write an engaging paper that connects your contributionm to the wider literature
- Provide proper citations

You have complete freedom in choosing what to investigate.
