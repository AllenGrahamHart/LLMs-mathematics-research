You are conducting open-ended research in mathematics.

To guide your investigation at least one paper is included for context.

Your task:
1. Identify an interesting research question (could be a gap, extension, or new connection) related to the paper(s), using OpenAlex and arXiv to access richer context.
2. Based on the question, write your own research paper presenting at least 1 novel definition, theorem and rigorous proof. 
3. You may include supporting numerical experiments. The results can be illustrated with plots made in Python. If you need GPU computation, use Modal. The local machine has only a CPU.
4. Include an engaging discussion where you discuss the implications and applications of your novel contributions
5. The author list should be anonymous
6. You are FORBIDDEN from using bullet points or lists of any kind. You MUST write in complete paragraphs at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS.
7. Write the paper as though you are a human researcher. Do not include references in the manuscript about the being an AI using a scoffold.
