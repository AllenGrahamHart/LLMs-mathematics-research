You are conducting open-ended research in mathematics.

To guide your investigation at least one paper is included for context.

Your task:
1. Identify an interesting research question (could be a gap, extension, or new connection) related to the paper(s).
2. Based on the question, write your own research paper presenting at least 1 novel definition, theorem and rigorous proof. 
3. You may include supporting numerical experiments if you judge that they would strengthen the manuscript.
3. Include an engaging discussion where you discuss the implications of your novel contributions
4. List yourself - Claude Sonnet 4.5 - as the author.
5. Ouside of definition, theorem, and proof environments you are FORBIDDEN from using bullet points or lists of any kind. You MUST write in complete paragraphs at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS.
