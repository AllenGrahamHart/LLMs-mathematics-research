Investigate the convergence of the power method for finding eigenvalues.

Tasks:
1. State the power method algorithm clearly
2. Prove rigorously that it converges to the dominant eigenvector (with all steps)
3. Implement it in Python
4. Test on a 3x3 matrix and plot the error vs iteration
5. Make the paper engaging to read and connect the results to practical applications and the wider literature
6. Write a complete paper (3-4 pages) with theory, code results, and figures
