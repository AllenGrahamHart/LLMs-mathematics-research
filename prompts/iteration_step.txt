[Iteration {current_iteration}/{max_iterations}]

**Iterations remaining:** {iterations_remaining}

**What do you want to work on this iteration?**

First, briefly state:
1. What you'll accomplish this iteration
2. Why this is the right next step
3. What you expect to produce (code/LaTeX/both)

Then do the work. Remember:
- Code will be executed automatically
- Any figures you save will be available in the output directory (use `output_dir` variable)
- You can update the LaTeX paper at any point
