I'm running a scaffolded research experiment. Here's the structure:

**Your research goal:**
{problem}

**How it works:**
At each iteration, you choose what to work on next. You'll:
1. Decide what needs to be done this iteration
2. Do the work (write code, update the paper, etc.)
3. Receive execution results
4. Self-assess and decide next steps

**Key constraints:**
- Maximum {max_iterations} iterations total
- You have complete flexibility in how to approach the problem
- Adapt your strategy as you learn what works

**Technical details:**
- Code in ```python blocks executes automatically
- The variable `output_dir` contains the path to your output directory
- To save figures: Use `plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_dir, 'your_filename.png'))` in your code
- Figures are NOT saved automatically - you MUST call plt.savefig() explicitly
- Reference saved figures in LaTeX using just the filename (e.g., \includegraphics{{your_filename.png}})
- LaTeX in ```latex blocks replaces paper.tex completely
- You maintain ONE evolving LaTeX document throughout (each update replaces the entire file)

**Success criteria:**
- Complete, rigorous research paper
- Working code with meaningful experiments
- Clear, engaging writing
- Proper citations (no fabrication)

Given {max_iterations} iterations, what's your overall strategy? How will you allocate your time?
